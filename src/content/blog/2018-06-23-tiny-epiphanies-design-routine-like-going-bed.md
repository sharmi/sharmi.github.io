<p>I found something on hn a few days back and i am trying to carry it around and make it a part of me.</p>
<p>"""For someone who hated routines and felt trapped. The simple advice that schedules are my friend and I should schedule my day in a way that would make me happy when I go to bed. Been doing this for 2 months now. Never been more productive or happier. """ <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17159515">src</a></p>
