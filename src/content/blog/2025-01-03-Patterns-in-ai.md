This blogpost is supposed to be a running log of observations/ideas/patterns I see over time. Some might build momentum, some might vaporize with time. But would really like to see how the game develops over time.

* AI would start cannibalizing the entry level jobs in various fields. We already see a reduction in need for developers, SDRs and similar roles. This could lead to a dearth of experienced software engineers, Sales Executives etc.
* AI has poured gasoline on the everybody-can-code trend. AI has given more people ever the confidence to jump into coding and see the benefits of automation. But there is always a saturation point beyond which you do need an expert. AI spotlights both the benefits of automation and the complexity of a well-built codebase in a way that no-code never did. I anticipate a lot of such experimentation of on good ideas that lead on to become successful projects for software engineers.
